# Indoor Scene Recognition

The project makes use of Convolutional Neural Network to detect certain Indoor Scenes from the MIT Places 365 Dataset. We used only 3 categories - Bedroom, Corridor and Kitchen for purpose of this project. We also created our custom dataset by downloading images
from Google Images for testing purposes.

The repository contains 2 folders:

1) CNN from scratch: 
    This folder contains code for the CNN model implemented from scratch which gives accuracy of about 77.67% .
    
2) Transfer Learning: 
    This folder contains code for CNN model developed using transfer learning. Some layers of AlexNet were used for transfer learning. This gave accuracy of around 91.33% .
